# DIAMOnD

DIAMOnD.py runs the DIAMOnD algorithm as described in
 
 A DIseAse MOdule Detection (DIAMOnD) Algorithm derived from a
 systematic analysis of connectivity patterns of disease proteins in
 the Human Interactome. PlOS Comp Bio (in press), 2015.

Instruction to use the source code:
1. Download the code.
2. Make sure to make the code executable by chmod +x DIAMOnD.py
3. Run the code (./DIAMOnD.py in command line or â€œrun DIAMOnD.py" in ipython). This will bring up the correct usage of the code.
4. Run the code according the suggested usage and input files description(See below).

# -------------------

Directory Example

contains two input files:
1. seed_genes.txt (list of genes associated with a phenotype of interest) 
2. PPI.txt (Protein-protein interaction network. note that gene IDs should be consistent in the two input files)
The following command will generate the first 100 DIAMOnD nodes and save them in a file)
./DIAMOnD.py PPI.txt seed_genes.txt 100
